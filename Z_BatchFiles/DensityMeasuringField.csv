Center,,XYPair,,"Position of the center of the density measuring field in the coordinates of the MarkObject that contains this mark. If the measuring field is defined within a ColorControlStrip, @Center SHALL refer to the rectangle defined by @Center and @Size of the ColorControlStrip."
Density,,FloatList,,Density value for each process color measured with filter. The sequence of colors SHALL be C M Y K.
Diameter,,float,,Diameter of the density measuring field.
DotGain,,float,,Percentage of dot gain.
Separation,,NMTOKEN,,Separation identifier that this DensityMeasuringField applies to. Additional details of the colorants SHOULD be provided in ResourceSet[@Name=”Color”].
ToleranceBlack,?,XYPair,,Upper and lower black measurement limits (in density units).
ToleranceCyan,?,XYPair,,Upper and lower cyan measurement limits (in density units).
ToleranceDotGain,?,XYPair,,Upper and lower measurement limits (in%).
ToleranceMagenta,?,XYPair,,Upper and lower magenta measurement limits (in density units).
ToleranceYellow,?,XYPair,,Upper and lower yellow measurement limits (in density units).
