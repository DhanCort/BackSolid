EarlyChange,?,integer,,"A code indicating when to increase the code word length. The TIFF specification can be interpreted to imply that code word length increases are postponed as long as possible. However, some existing implementations of LZW increase the code word length one code word earlier than necessary. The PostScript language supports both interpretations. If @EarlyChange is ""0"", code word length increases are postponed as long as possible. If it is ""1"", they occur one code word early."
Predictor,?,integer,,"A code that selects the predictor function. Note: On ""1n"" PNG predictors, these values select the specific PNG predictor function(s) to be used. When decoding, the predictor function SHALL be explicitly encoded in the incoming data. Values include: 1 – No predictor (normal encoding or decoding). 2 – TIFF Predictor 2. 10 – PNG predictor, None function. 11 – PNG predictor, Sub function. 12 – PNG predictor, Up function. 13 – PNG predictor, Average function. 14 – PNG predictor, Path function. 15 – PNG predictor in which the encoding filter SHALL automatically choose the optimum function separately for each row."
