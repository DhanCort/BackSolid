ImageInternalTrapping,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the planes of color images are trapped against each other. If ""false"", the planes of color images are not trapped against each other."
ImageMaskTrapping,?,boolean,,"Controls trapping when the image contains a stencil mask. A stencil mask is a monochrome image in which each sample is represented by a single bit. The stencil mask is used to paint in the current color: image samples with a value of ""1"" are marked, samples with a value of ""0"" are not marked. When ""false"", none of the objects covered by the clipped bounding box of the stencil mask are trapped. No traps are generated between the stencil mask and objects that the stencil mask overlays. No traps are generated between objects that overlay the stencil mask and the stencil mask. For all other objects, normal trapping rules are followed. Two objects on top of the stencil mask that overlap each other might generate a trap, regardless of the value of this parameter. When ""true"", objects are trapped to the stencil mask, and to each other."
ImageToImageTrapping,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", traps are generated along a boundary between images. If ""false"", this kind of trapping is not implemented."
ImageToObjectTrapping,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", images are trapped to other objects. If ""false"", this kind of trapping is not implemented."
MinimumBlackWidth,?,float,,"Specifies the minimum width, in points, of a trap that uses black ink. Allowable values are those greater than or equal to zero."
StepLimit,?,float,,"A non-negative number. Specifies the smallest step needed in the color value of a colorant to trigger trapping at a given boundary. If the higher color value at the boundary exceeds the lower value by an amount that is equal to or greater than the larger of 0.05 or @StepLimit times the lower value, i.e. if Valuehi >= Valuelo + max (@StepLimit * Valuelo, 0.05)) then the edge is a candidate for trapping. The value 0.05 is set to avoid trapping light areas in vignettes."
TrapColorScaling,?,float,,"A number between 0 and 1. Specifies a scaling of the amount of color applied in traps towards the neutral density of the dark area. A value of ""1"" means the trap has the combined color values of the darker and the lighter area. A value of ""0"" means the trap colors are reduced so that the trap has the neutral density of the darker area."
TrapWidth,?,XYPair,,Specifies the trap width in the X and Y directions of the page or surface ByteMap.
