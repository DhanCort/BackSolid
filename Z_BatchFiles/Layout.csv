Automated,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the Imposition process is expected to perform automated imposition. Layout/@Automated SHALL be identical for all Layout elements of a ResourceSet."
FilmRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to film Media that SHALL provide a description of the physical media that will be marked.
InnermostShingling,?,float,,"Relative creep compensation that SHALL be applied to the innermost part of the assembled booklet. A value of ""1"" SHALL specify 100% creep compensation. Shingling is perpendicular to the spine. Negative values go towards the spine. Values for pages between inner and outer SHALL be interpolated. Actual values of shingling are calculated by the system or operator. See ?Figure 6-24: Shingling for stripping and ?Figure 6-25: Shingling for stripping – details."
MaxCollect,?,integer,,"Maximum number of sheets that SHALL be collected into a signature. @MaxCollect modifies the pagination when automated imposition is selected by splitting documents of the input RunList into smaller virtual documents that fill exactly one signature. Thus the ord counting within a Layout SHALL be restarted at 0 after @MaxCollect sheets. The distribution of signatures with less than @MaxCollect sheets within the final product is implementation dependent. Example: If 10 sheets are required and @MaxCollect=4, then 3-3-4, 4-4-2 or any permutations are possible. See also @MinCollect. If not specified, all sheets SHALL be collected into one signature."
MinCollect,?,integer,,"Minimum number of sheets that SHALL be collected into a signature. @MinCollect modifies the pagination when automated imposition is selected. The distribution of signatures with less than @MaxCollect sheets within the final product is implementation dependent. Example: If 10 sheets are required and @MaxCollect=4, @MinCollect=3, then only 3-3-4, or any permutations are possible. Example: If 2 sheets are required and @MinCollect=3, then a third sheet with only blank pages SHALL be produced."
OutermostShingling,?,float,,"Relative creep compensation that SHALL be applied to the outermost part of the assembled booklet. A value of ""1"" SHALL specify 100% creep compensation. Shingling is perpendicular to the spine. Negative values go towards the spine. Values for pages between inner and outer SHALL be interpolated. Actual values of shingling are calculated by the system or operator. See ?Figure 6-24: Shingling for stripping and ?Figure 6-25: Shingling for stripping – details."
PaperRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to final paper Media that SHALL provide a description of the physical media that will be marked.
PlateRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to plate Media that SHALL provide a description of the physical media that will be marked.
ProofPaperRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to paper Media that SHALL be used for proofing and that SHALL provide a description of the physical media that will be marked.
SurfaceContentsBox,?,rectangle,,"This box, specified in Layout-coordinate space, defines the area into which PlacedObject elements SHALL be positioned. Content that is outside of the area specified by @SurfaceContentsBox SHALL be clipped. The lower left corner of the rectangle establishes the coordinate system onto which the content SHALL be positioned and SHOULD have a value of ""0 0"". If this attribute is not supplied, the origin SHALL be ""0 0"" and the extent is undefined."
WorkStyle,?,enumeration,WorkStyle,The direction in which to turn the press sheet.
Device,*,element,,"List of Device resources that the MIS expects to execute this Layout. This MAY include prepress devices, presses or finishing devices."
FileSpec,,element,,Reference to an external imposition template in a proprietary format. Layout SHOULD NOT contain information that overlaps information specified in FileSpec(ExternalImpositionTemplate). Information specified in Layout SHALL override parameters specified in FileSpec(ExternalImpositionTemplate).
FitPolicy,?,element,,Specifies automated fit policy for content that is placed onto the surface that is specified in @SurfaceContentsBox.
PlacedObject,*,element,,PlacedObject elements specify content or marks that SHALL be placed on the surface in the order in which they occur in the Layout. All PlacedObject elements SHALL be specified in Layout Resources that contain at least one Part/ @Side.
Position,*,element,,"The Position elements specify how the BinderySignature SHALL be placed onto a sheet. Multiple Position objects that reference the same BinderySignature specify multiple identical BinderySignature elements with the same content. If Position elements are specified and @WorkStyle=""WorkAndTurn"" or @WorksStyle=""WorkAndTumble"" the mirrored Position elements are not implied and Position elements SHALL be specified for those positions."
SheetActivation,?,element,,"Specifies the conditions under which the optional sheet defined by this Layout SHALL be produced. SheetActivation SHALL only be present when Layout/@Automated=""true"". SheetActivation SHALL activate the surface as specified by Part/@Side if present. Thus if two surfaces are present in the Layout and only one surface contains SheetActivation, then the sheet shall be printed on one side only. If Part/ @Side is not specified, e.g. if the Layout is used as an input to Stripping, then SheetActivation SHALL apply to both surfaces of the sheet."
StripMark,*,element,,StripMark provides a description of production marks for Stripping in the context of the Layout. See also PlacedObject/MarkObject for a description of the individual marks.
