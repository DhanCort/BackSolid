ICCProfileUsage,?,enumeration,,"@ICCProfileUsage specifies where to obtain either the destination profile or device link transform that SHALL be applied. Note: Use of a final target device profile provides a profiled destination to be used when converting a source object through PCS (Profiled Connection Space) to that profiled destination, and a device link transform specifies a conversion of the source object from the source space directly to the destination. Note: PDF/X workflows assume that @ICCProfileUsage=”UsePDL”."
ColorSpaceConversionOp,*,element,,"List of ColorSpaceConversionOp elements, each of which identifies a type of object, defines the source color space for that type of object, and specifies the behavior of the conversion operation for that type of object. The XML order of ColorSpaceConversionOp elements is significant, and when multiple elements apply to the same object, they are applied in that XML order. A ColorSpaceConversionOp can modify the characteristics of an object such that its selection criteria is also modified. Thus, if two ColorSpaceConversionOp elements select the same set of objects, and the first element changes the object in such a way that the object would no longer be selected by the second element, then the second ColorSpaceConversionOp SHALL NOT be applied to that object."
FileSpec,?,element,,A FileSpec element pointing to an ICC profile that describes the characterization of the final output target device.
