BackPages,?,IntegerList,,"Page numbers of the back pages of a SignatureCell. The number of entries in @FrontPages and @BackPages SHALL be identical. The entries with an identical index in @FrontPages and @BackPages are back-to-back in the layout. If not specified, the layout is one-sided."
BackSpread,?,IntegerList,,List of indices of SignatureCell elements that are combined into a spread on the back side.
BleedFace,?,float,,Amount of bleed that SHALL be added to the box defined in @TrimBox at the face side.
BleedFoot,?,float,,Amount of bleed that SHALL be added to the box defined in @TrimBox at the foot side.
BleedHead,?,float,,Amount of bleed that SHALL be added to the box defined in @TrimBox at the head side.
BleedSpine,?,float,,Amount of bleed that SHALL be added to the box defined in @TrimBox at the spine side.
FaceCells,?,IntegerList,,"List of indices of SignatureCell elements that form a foldout together with this SignatureCell. The SignatureCell that contains @FaceCells is the parent of the foldout, typically the page that is attached to the spine. Details of each foldout page are described by a SignatureCell element."
FrontPages,?,IntegerList,,Page numbers of the front pages of a SignatureCell. Multiple page cells with the same properties except for the pages to which they are assigned MAY be summarized as one SignatureCell with multiple entries in @FrontPages.
FrontSpread,?,IntegerList,,List of indices of SignatureCell elements that are combined into a spread on the front side.
Mask,?,enumeration,Mask,"The definition of the clipping mask for the placed graphics. Allowed values are: BleedBox – The mask is derived from the bleed box as defined by the SignatureCell. DieCut – The mask SHALL be derived from the cut line as defined in DieLayout/@CutLines. None – No mask. PDL – The mask is derived from the PDL of the graphics. @MaskSeparation MAY determine which separation SHALL be used as the clipping mask for the graphics. If @MaskSeparation is not present, the mask SHALL be determined from the underlying PDL, e.g. ?[ISO19593-1:2016]. SourceBleedBox – The mask is derived from the bleed box of the graphical element placed in the SignatureCell. SourceTrimBox – The mask is derived from the trim box of the graphical element placed in the SignatureCell. TrimBox – The mask is derived from the trim box as defined by the SignatureCell."
MaskBleed,?,float,,The distance over which to expand the mask in points.
MaskSeparation,?,NMTOKEN,,"Color/../Resource/Part/@Separation of the Color that specifies @Mask. @MaskSeparation SHALL NOT be specified unless @Mask=""PDL"". Color/ @ColorType of this separation SHALL be ""DieLine""."
Orientation,?,enumeration,OrientationSC,Indicates the orientation of the SignatureCell on the BinderySignature. Allowed values are: Down – 180° rotation. Left – 90° counter-clockwise rotation. Right – 270° counter-clockwise rotation Up – 0° rotation.
Sides,?,enumeration,Sides,Sides SHALL specify which side of the media SHALL be printed. Allowed value is from: ?Sides.
StationName,?,NMTOKEN,,"The name of the 1-up station in the die layout. If BinderySignature/@BinderySignatureType=""Die"", this element SHOULD be specified. If BinderySignature/@BinderySignatureType=""Die"" and the DieLayout referenced by BinderySignature/@DieLayoutRef contains more than 1 Station, this attribute SHALL be specified."
TrimFace,?,float,,"Value for the trim distance at the face side. When no Folding is done, this is the right margin. When @BinderySignatureType=""Grid"", the horizontal gutter between cells is @TrimFace + @TrimSpine."
TrimFoot,?,float,,"Value for the trim distance at the foot side. When no Folding is done, this is the bottom margin. When @BinderySignatureType=""Grid"", the vertical gutter between cells is @TrimHead +@TrimFoot."
TrimHead,?,float,,"Value for the trim distance at the head side. When no Folding is done, this is the top margin. When @BinderySignatureType=""Grid"", the vertical gutter between cells is @TrimHead +@TrimFoot. Note: See ?Appendix F Pagination Catalog"
TrimSize,?,XYPair,,"@TrimSize defines the dimensions of the trim box. If not specified, @TrimSize SHALL be extracted from the PDL that is referenced from the input RunList(Document) of the Stripping or Imposition process."
TrimSpine,?,float,,"Amount of paper that is not cut-off from the spine. When no Folding is done, this is the left margin. When @BinderySignatureType=""Grid"", the horizontal gutter between cells is @TrimFace + @TrimSpine. Note: See ?Appendix F Pagination Catalog."
