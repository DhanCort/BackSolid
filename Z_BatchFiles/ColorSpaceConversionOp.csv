Operation,,enumeration,,@Operation specifies the task that this ColorSpaceConversionOp defines.
PreserveBlack,?,boolean,,"Controls how the tints of black (K in CMYK) are to be handled. If @PreserveBlack is ""false"", these colors are processed through the standard ICC workflow. If @PreserveBlack is ""true"", these colors are to be converted into other shades of black. The algorithm is implementation-specific."
RenderingIntent,?,enumeration,,Identifies the rendering intent to be applied when rendering the objects selected by this ColorSpaceConversionOp.
RGBGray2Black,?,boolean,,This feature controls what happens to gray values (R = G = B) when converting from RGB to CMYK or the incoming graphical objects indicated by @SourceObjects. Gray values that exceed the @RGBGray2BlackThreshold SHALL NOT be converted. @RGBGray2Black and @RGBGray2BlackThreshold are used by the ColorSpaceConversion process in determining how to allocate RGB values to the black (K) channel.
RGBGray2BlackThreshold,?,float,,"When @RGBGray2Black is ""true"", @RGBGray2BlackThreshold SHALL be a value between ""0.0"" and ""1.0"" that specifies the threshold value above which the device SHALL NOT convert gray (R = G = B) to black (K only). Thus a value of ""0.0"" will convert only R = G = B = 0 (black) to K, whereas a value of ""1.0"" will convert all values of R = G = B to K."
Separations,?,NMTOKENS,,"List of separation identifiers that specify on which separation(s) to operate when @SourceCS=""Separation"". Additional details of the colorants SHOULD be provided in ResourceSet[@Name=”Color”]."
SourceCS,?,enumeration,SourceColorSpace,Identifies which of the incoming color spaces SHALL be operated on. If @SourceCS is not specified then ColorSpaceConversionOp SHALL apply to all color spaces.
SourceObjects,?,enumerations,SourceObjects,List of object classes that identifies which incoming graphical objects SHALL be operated on. If @SourceObjects is not specified then ColorSpaceConversionOp SHALL apply to all object classes.
SourceRenderingIntent,?,enumeration,RenderingIntent,Identifies the rendering intent transform elements to be selected from the source profile that will be used to interpret objects of type identified by the @SourceObjects and @SourceCS attributes. If not specified then the value from @RenderingIntent SHOULD be used.
FileSpec,?,element,,FileSpec(DeviceLinkProfile) specifies an ICC profile file that contains a device link transform. See ?[ICC.1].
ScreenSelector,?,element,,"If specified, only objects that match the screening properties defined in ScreenSelector SHALL be operated on."
