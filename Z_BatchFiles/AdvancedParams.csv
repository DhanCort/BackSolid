AllowPSXObjects,?,boolean,,"If ""false"", PostScript XObjects SHALL not be created."
AllowTransparency,?,boolean,,"If ""false"", transparency SHALL not be present in the PDF."
AutoPositionEPSInfo,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the process SHALL automatically resize and center information from EPS source files on the page. (EPS source only)"
EmbedJobOptions,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the PDF settings used to create the PDF SHALL be embedded in the PDF."
EmitDSCWarnings,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", warning messages about questionable or incorrect DSC comments MAY appear during the processing of the source PostScript file. (PostScript source only)"
LockDistillerParams,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", any PDFCreationDetails settings configured by the source content (e.g., with setdistillerparams in a PostScript source document) SHALL be ignored. If ""false"", each parameter defined in the source document SHALL override that set in the XJDF."
ParseDSCCommentForDocInfo,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the process SHALL parse the DSC comments in a PostScript source file and extract the document information. This information SHALL be recorded in the info dictionary of the PDF file."
ParseDSCComments,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the process SHALL parse the DSC comments in a PostScript source document for any information that might be helpful for converting the file or for information that is to be stored in the PDF file. If ""false"", the process SHALL treat the DSC comments as pure PS comments and SHALL ignore them. (PostScript source only)"
PassThroughJPEGImages,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", JPEG images SHALL be passed through without recompressing them."
PreserveCopyPage,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the copypage operator of PostScript Level 2 SHALL be maintained. If ""false"", the PostScript Level 3 definition of the copypage operator SHALL be used. In PostScript Levels 1 and 2, the copypage operator transmits the page contents to the current output device (similar to showpage). However, copypage does not perform many of the re-initializations that showpage does. Many PostScript Level 1 and 2 programs used the copypage operator to perform such operations as printing multiple copies and implementing forms. These programs produce incorrect results when interpreted using the Level 3 copypage semantics. This attribute provides a mechanism to retain Level 2 compatibility for this operator. (PostScript source only)"
PreserveEPSInfo,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the EPS information in a PostScript source file SHALL be preserved and SHALL be stored in the resulting PDF file. (PostScript source only)"
PreserveHalftoneInfo,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the halftone screen information (frequency, angle and spot function) SHALL be passed into the PDF file. If ""false"", halftone information SHALL not be passed on."
PreserveOPIComments,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", Open Prepress Interface (OPI) low resolution images SHALL be encapsulated as a form and information for locating the high resolution images SHALL be preserved."
PreserveOverprintSettings,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the value of the setoverprint operator SHALL be passed through to the PDF file. Otherwise, overprint SHALL be ignored."
TransferFunctionInfo,?,enumeration,,Determines how transfer functions are handled.
UCRandBGInfo,?,enumeration,,"Determines whether the under-color removal and black-generation parameters from the source document (e.g., the arguments to the PostScript commands setundercolorremoval and setblackgeneration) SHALL be passed into the PDF file."
UsePrologue,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the process SHALL append a PostScript prologue file before the beginning of the job and append a PostScript epilog file after the end the job. Such files are used to control the PostScript environment for the conversion process. The expected location and allowable contents for these files is defined by the process implementation.
