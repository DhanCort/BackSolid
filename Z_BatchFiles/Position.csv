AbsoluteBox,?,rectangle,,"Absolute position, in points, of the display area of this BinderySignature on the front side of the Layout. The BinderySignature is placed onto the display area after applying the @Orientation transformation. The display area SHALL include the absolute margins defined by @MarginTop, @MarginBottom, @MarginLeft and @MarginRight. @AbsoluteBox overrides @RelativeBox if both are specified. If @AbsoluteBox is specified, it SHALL be used as is for all imposition calculations."
BinderySignatureID,?,NMTOKEN,,"If present, @BinderySignatureID SHALL reference a BinderySignature/../Part/ @BinderySignatureID that SHALL be placed onto the layout at this position. If @BinderySignatureID is not specified, individual pages SHALL be placed at this Position."
BlockName,?,NMTOKEN,,Identifies a CutBlock resulting from a Cutting process if the element specified by the Position is created by Cutting.
GangElementID,?,NMTOKEN,,"If present, @GangElementID SHALL reference a GangElement element that was placed in this position by SheetOptimizing."
ID,?,ID,,Identifier of this Position. @ID SHALL be used to link PlacedObject elements to a Position.
MarginBottom,?,float,,"Bottom margin, in points, to be left outside of the BinderySignature that this Position applies to. The coordinate system is defined by the front side of the Layout."
MarginLeft,?,float,,"Left margin, in points, to be left outside of the BinderySignature that this Position applies to. The coordinate system is defined by the front side of the Layout."
MarginRight,?,float,,"Right margin, in points, to be left outside of the BinderySignature that this Position applies to. The coordinate system is defined by the front side of the Layout."
MarginTop,?,float,,"Top margin, in points, to be left outside of the BinderySignature that this Position applies to. The coordinate system is defined by the front side of the Layout."
Orientation,?,enumeration,Orientation,"Named orientation describing the transformation of the orientation of the BinderySignature on the Layout. For details, see ?Table 2.1 Matrices and Orientation values for describing the orientation of a Component. Allowed value is from: ?Orientation."
RelativeBox,?,rectangle,,"@RelativeBox is a rough definition of the general position of the display area of this BinderySignature on the front side of the Layout. The BinderySignature SHALL be placed onto the display area after applying the @Orientation transformation. The display area SHOULD include the absolute margins defined by @MarginTop, @MarginBottom, @MarginLeft and @MarginRight. @AbsoluteBox overrides @RelativeBox if both are specified. If neither @AbsoluteBox nor @RelativeBox are specified, the full relative media box ""0 0 1.0 1.0"" SHALL be applied."
StackDepth,?,integer,,"Maximum number of sheets on a stack for cut and stack imposition. Implementations SHOULD generate the minimum stack size to accommodate the available number of input pages. If Position/@Orientation specifies a flip of the pages, then the stack SHALL be filled in descending page order."
StackOrd,?,integer,,"Index of the stack. The stacks SHALL be processed in the sequence of ascending @StackOrd. If @StackOrd is specified for any individual Layout partition, @StackOrd SHALL be specified for all Position elements of that Layout"
