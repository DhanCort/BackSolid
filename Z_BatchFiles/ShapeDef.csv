Area,?,float,,"The net area of the shape in m2, after cutting"
CutBox,?,rectangle,,A rectangle describing the bounding box of all cut lines. This is sometimes referred to as the knife to knife dimensions of a blank box.
CutLines,?,NMTOKENS,,"Selects the die line separation identifiers from the file referenced by FileSpec. Additional details of the usage of the separations MAY be specified in the respective ResourceSet[@Name=""Color""]."
Dimensions,?,shape,,"Width x, height y and depth z coordinates of the open 3D shape. For a box, these are the outer dimensions of the opened and potentially filled box (e.g., for palletizing of the final products). Note: Compare with @FlatDimensions."
FlatDimensions,?,shape,,"Width x, height y and depth z coordinates of the flat 3D shape. For a box, these are the outer dimensions of the glued flat box (e.g., for palletizing of the boxes prior to filling). This corresponds to Component/@Dimensions of the output of the BoxFolding process. Note: Compare with @Dimensions."
FluteDirection,?,enumeration,MediaDirection,Intended direction of the flute for this design in the coordinate system defined by @CutBox. This information SHALL be taken into account by the DieLayoutProduction process to give the ShapeDef the correct orientation on the sheet. Allowed value is from: ?MediaDirection.
GrainDirection,?,enumeration,MediaDirection,Intended direction of the grain for this design in the coordinate system defined by @CutBox. This information SHALL be taken into account by the DieLayoutProduction process to give the ShapeDef the correct orientation on the sheet. Allowed value is from: ?MediaDirection
MediaRef,?,IDREF,,"Reference to a Media resource for which this structural design was intended. The Media description defines important design parameters, such as the type of Media, thickness, inside loss, outside gain, etc."
MediaSide,?,enumeration,Side,"Determines the printing side for which the DieLayout is made. ""Front"" corresponds to the outside of a box, ""Back"" corresponds to the inside of a box. Allowed value is from: ?Side. Note: Folding carton is usually cut from the outside (Front), corrugated from the inside (Back)."
ResourceWeight,?,float,,The weight of the shape after cutting (g).
FileSpec,?,element,,"The FileSpec of the structural design file. The format of this file may be a vendor specific format, a standard format like ?[DDES3], a less well specified but commonly used format like CFF2 or DXF or even a PDF or EPS file. FileSpec and Shape are mutually exclusive."
Shape,*,element,,The shape is defined by a collection of Shape elements. Shape and FileSpec are mutually exclusive.
