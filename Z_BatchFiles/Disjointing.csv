Amount,?,integer,,"The number of components that SHALL be shifted in @Direction simultaneously. @Units SHALL specify the type of the component counted by this attribute. Any less granular component break than the value of @Units SHALL cause a shift regardless of the value of @Amount, e.g. a set break would cause a shift even if the current number of documents were less than @Amount in the case where @Units=""Docs"" or @Units=""DocCopies""."
Direction,?,enumeration,Direction,"Offset-shift action for the first component. A component can be offset to one of two positions—left or right. Allowed values are: Alternate – The position of the first component of a new job is opposite to the position of the previous component and subsequent components are each offset to alternating positions. For example, if the last item in the stack was positioned to the right then the subsequent items will be positioned to the left, right, left, right and so on. Left – The first component of a new job is on the left, and subsequent components are each offset to alternating positions. None – Do not offset consecutive components. The position of all components is the same as the position of the previous component. Right – The first component of a new job is on the right, and subsequent components are each offset to alternating positions."
Offset,?,XYPair,,Offset dimension in X and Y dimensions that separates the components.
Units,?,NMTOKEN,NMUnits,"This attribute specifies the type of component counted by the @Amount attribute. Values include: DocCopies - Every individual document is counted. Docs - All copies of identical documents are counted as one. Jobs - The entire job SHALL be counted. For this case @Amount SHALL have a value of 1, i.e. when @Units=""Jobs"", @Amount=""1"". SetCopies - Every individual set is counted. Sets - All copies of identical sets are counted as one. Sheets - Every individual sheet is counted."
InsertSheet,?,element,,"Some kind of physical marker (e.g., a paper strip or a yellow paper sheet) that separates the components."
