FoldCatalog,?,NMTOKEN,,Describes the folding scheme.
FoldingDetails,?,NMTOKEN,,"@FoldingDetails is a system dependent descriptor of the folding. @FoldingDetails MAY be used to differentiate differing fold dimensions with the same general topology, such as asymmetrical Z-folds. @FoldingDetails SHALL NOT be specified if @FoldCatalog is not present."
Orientation,?,enumeration,Orientation,"@Orientation indicates the orientation of the unfolded product with respect to the lay of the fold. A value of ""Rotate0"" SHALL be mapped to the lay of the fold on the lower left of the product prior to folding and the front side of the product oriented in the direction of an upward fold"
Crease,*,element,,"Crease elements describe the details of any creasing operations in the coordinate system of the final product. If no geometrical details are specified in the Crease element and a @FoldCatalog is specified, the customer is requesting production creasing."
Fold,*,element,,This describes the details of folding operations in the sequence described by the value of @FoldCatalog. Fold SHALL be specified if non-symmetrical folds are requested.
Perforate,*,element,,"Perforate elements describe the details of any perforating operations in the coordinate system of the final product. If no geometrical details are specified in the Perforate element and a @FoldCatalog is specified, the customer is requesting production perforation."
