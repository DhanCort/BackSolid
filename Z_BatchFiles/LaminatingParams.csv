GapList,?,FloatList,,"List of non-laminated gap positions in the X direction of the laminating tool in the coordinate system of the Component. The zero-based even entries define the absolute position of the start of a gap, and the odd entries define the end of a gap. If not specified, the complete area defined by @LaminatingBox is laminated."
LaminatingBox,?,rectangle,,Area on the Component that SHALL be laminated
LaminatingMethod,?,enumeration,,Laminating technology that SHALL be applied.
ModuleID,?,NMTOKEN,,"Identifier of the laminating module in a multi-function device, such as a printing press. See Module for details."
NipWidth,?,float,,Width of the nip in points that SHALL be formed between the fusing rollers and the component in the Laminating process.
Temperature,?,float,,Temperature that SHALL be used in the Laminating process.
