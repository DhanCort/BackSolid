Angle,?,float,,"Specifies the first angle of the screen when AM screening is used, otherwise @Angle is ignored."
DotSize,?,float,,"Specifies the dot size of the screen, in microns [µm], when FM screening (@ScreeningType = ""FM"" or ""Adaptive"") is used."
Frequency,?,float,,"Specifies the halftone screen frequency in lines per inch (lpi) of the screen when AM screening is used, otherwise @Frequency is ignored. With some screens, frequency can change as a function of gray level. In this case, the @Frequency value is interpreted for a mid tone (50%) gray level."
ScreeningFamily,?,string,,Vendor specific screening family name.
ScreeningType,?,enumeration,,General type of screening.
Separation,?,NMTOKEN,,The separation identifier that this ScreenSelector SHALL apply to. Additional details of the colorants SHOULD be provided in ResourceSet[@Name=”Color”].
SourceFrequencyMax,?,float,,Specifies the maximum line frequency of screens that SHALL be matched from the source file when screen matching is to be done. Note: This is a filter that selects on which objects to apply this ScreenSelector.
SourceFrequencyMin,?,float,,Specifies the minimum line frequency of screens that SHALL be matched from the source file when screen matching is to be done. Note: This is a filter that selects on which objects to apply this ScreenSelector.
SourceObjects,?,enumerations,SourceObjects,Identifies the class(es) of incoming graphical objects on which to use the selected screen. If @SourceObjects is not specified then ScreenSelector SHALL apply to all object classes.
SpotFunction,?,NMTOKEN,NMSpotFunction,"Specifies the spot function of the screen when AM screening is used. In general, it is common for a spot function to change its shape as a function of gray level. Response to these spot function names MAY be implementationdependent. These example names are the same as the spot function names defined in PDF."
