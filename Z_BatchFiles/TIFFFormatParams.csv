ByteOrder,?,enumeration,ByteOrder,Byte order of the TIFF file. Allowed values are: II – Low byte first. MM – High byte first. Note: The identifier values have been selected to match the identifier with the same purpose within the TIFF file itself.
Interleaving,?,integer,,"How the components of each pixel are stored. The values are taken from TIFF tag 284—PlanarConfiguration: Allowed values are: 1 – “Chunky” format, which is pixel interleaved. 2 – “Planar” format, which is strip interleaved."
RowsPerStrip,?,integer,,"The number of image scan lines per strip, encoded in the TIFF file as RowsPerStrip. This attribute is ignored if @Segmentation!=""Stripped"". The default, if not known, is set by the processing system with the exception that when converting from ByteMap to TIFF, ByteMap/Band/@Height is the default."
Segmentation,?,enumeration,Segmentation,How the image data are segmented. Allowed values are: SingleStrip – All data are included in one segment. This is encoded in the TIFF file by setting RowsPerStrip to a number equal to or larger than the number of pixel rows in the image. Stripped – Data are segmented into strips. Tiled – Data are segmented into tiles.
SeparationNameTag,?,integer,,"When color separations are stored in individual TIFF files it is often useful to mark each with the name of the colorant that it represents, but there is no universally accepted way to do this. In order to avoid the need for explicit partitioning, the tag to be used to encode the separation name (as a string) can be entered here as the TIFF tag number. If the same TIFF tag number is also supplied as a TIFFtag subelement, then the TIFFtag element takes priority over @SeparationNameTag. The tag SHOULD only be put in the resulting TIFF files if the name of the separation is known."
TileSize,?,XYPair,,"Two integers. The X value provides width of tiles, and the Y value provides height of tiles. @TileSize SHALL NOT be specified unless @Segmentation=""Tiled""."
WhiteIsZero,?,boolean,,"When writing monochrome or gray scale files, this flag indicates whether the data SHALL be written with either white values encoded as zero, ""true"" or black values encoded as zero, ""false""."
TIFFEmbeddedFile,*,element,,"Files to be embedded within the created TIFF file. These might include an ICC profile, XMP data, etc."
TIFFtag,*,element,,Specific tag values for inclusion in the TIFF file.
