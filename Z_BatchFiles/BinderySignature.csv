BinderySignatureSize,?,XYPair,,Size of the BinderySignature. @BinderySignatureSize SHALL be identical to the sum of sizes including trim of all SignatureCells.
BinderySignatureType,,enumeration,BinderySignatureType,"@BinderySignatureType specifies the type of BinderySignature and the pagination rules. Allowed values are: Die – A layout defined by an existing die. Fold – The BinderySignature represents a folding signature. The pagination SHALL be calculated from the Assembly, Layout and BinderySignature. See ?Appendix F Pagination Catalog. Grid – The BinderySignature represents a grid based layout. The pagination SHALL be explicitly specified in SignatureCell/@FrontPages and SignatureCell/@BackPages. Grid SHALL be used for flatwork."
BindingOrientation,?,enumeration,Orientation,"After folding a BinderySignature, the default coordinate system SHALL be the coordinate system with the binding edge on the left side and the jog edge at the top. @BindingOrientation defines the transformation that SHALL be applied to the BinderySignature prior to calculating pagination. For example, a value of ""Rotate180"" would rotate every page by 180° but retain the pagination whereas a value of ""Flip180"" would reverse the pagination while retaining the page orientation. Note: In some cases, the first page of a BinderySignature is placed on the back side of the sheet. For details, see ?Table 2.1 Matrices and Orientation values for describing the orientation of a Component. Value is from: ?Orientation"
Bottling,?,enumeration,Bottling,"@Bottling SHALL specify the method to use for compensating the bottle angle, which is the slight rotation of a page needed to compensate for the rotation fault introduced when making cross-folds. Allowed values are: All - Compensate all cross-folds. Last - Compensate only the bottle angle caused by the final fold. None - Do not compensate."
DieLayoutRef,?,IDREF,,"@DieLayoutRef references a pre-existing die. The content SHALL be imposed to fit the shapes of the referenced DieLayout. DieLayout SHALL NOT be present unless @BinderySignatureType=""Die""."
FoldCatalog,?,NMTOKEN,NMFoldCatalog,"@FoldCatalog describes folding of the BinderySignature. At least one of SignatureCell, @FoldCatalog or @DieLayoutRef SHALL be specified. Values include those from: ?Fold Catalog."
NumberUp,?,XYPair,,"Specifies a regular, multi-up grid of SignatureCell elements into which content pages are mapped. The first value specifies the number of columns of SignatureCell elements, and the second value specifies the number of rows of SignatureCell elements in the multi-up grid (both numbers SHALL be positive integers)."
Overfold,?,float,,Size of the overfold.
OverfoldSide,?,enumeration,OverfoldSide,Position of the overfold in the finished signature. Allowed values are: Back - The overfold is on the back side. All pages have an overfold. BackHalf - The overfold is on the back side. Only pages on one side of the unfolded signature have an overfold. Front - The overfold is on the front side. All pages have an overfold. FrontHalf - The overfold is on the front side. Only pages on one side of the unfolded signature have an overfold.
StaggerColumns,?,FloatList,,"A list of values describing the staggering for subsequent columns. The number of entries in the list describes the periodicity of the staggering. Each value gives a factor of the SignatureCell height ((y value of @TrimSize) + @TrimHead + @TrimFoot) by which to shift the corresponding column. Note: Each value MAY be negative e.g., @StaggerColumns=""0.0 -0.333 0.666"" specifies to shift each: • 3*n column up by 0% • 3*n+1 column down by 33.3% of the SignatureCell height • 3*n+2 column up by 66.6% of the SignatureCell height This element SHALL NOT be present unless @BinderySignatureType=""Grid"". At most one of @StaggerColumns or @StaggerRows SHALL be specified."
StaggerContinuous,?,boolean,,"Indicates if the BinderySignature SHALL be considered as a continuous repetition for staggering. This attribute SHALL NOT be present unless exactly one of @StaggerRows or @StaggerColumns is specified. Consider a grid with m columns and n rows with @StaggerContinuous=""true"". If @StaggerColumns is specified, the BinderySignature SHALL be considered continuous with a height H equal to n multiplied by the SignatureCell height. If @StaggerColumns has a value of y for a certain column, that column is shifted up (assuming y > 0) by an amount equal to y multiplied by the SignatureCell height (in the same way as described for @StaggerColumns). All content (even partial cells) that falls above H (the top of BinderySignature) is shifted to the bottom such that the top of the shifted content is just below the original bottom cell in the column. For example, if y is 0.666, then the top 66.6% of the top cell is shifted to be just below the original bottom cell. Analogous for @StaggerRows."
StaggerRows,?,FloatList,,"A list of values describing the staggering for subsequent rows. The number of entries in the list describes the periodicity of the staggering. Each value gives a factor of the SignatureCell width by which to shift the corresponding row. Note: Each value MAY be negative e.g., ""0.0 0.333 -0.666"" specifies to shift each • 3*n row right by 0% • 3*n+1 row right by 33.3% of the SignatureCell width • 3*n+2 row left by 66.6% of the SignatureCell width This element SHALL NOT be present unless @BinderySignatureType=""Grid"". At most one of @StaggerColumns or @StaggerRows SHALL be specified."
SignatureCell,*,element,,"Describes the SignatureCell elements used in this BinderySignature. SignatureCell elements are ordered in X-Y direction starting at the lower left corner of the BinderySignature. When both SignatureCell and @FoldCatalog are specified, @FoldCatalog defines the topology of the folding scheme, and the specifics of each individual signature cell are described by the SignatureCell elements. The SignatureCell elements SHALL have precedence."
