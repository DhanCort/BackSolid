Automation,?,enumeration,Automation,"Identifies dynamic and static RunList elements. Generating Resource/Part in automated imposition is defined in detail in ?Section 5.4.8.1 Execution Model for Automated Imposition. This structure SHALL be retained in the RunList description. If @Automation=""Dynamic"" and ResourceSet/Dependent/@PipeID is also present, details MAY be specified in XJMF pipe messages. See ?Section 9.3.5.1 Dynamic Pipes. Allowed value is from: ?Automation."
ClipPath,?,PDFPath,,"Path that describes the outline of the RunList that SHALL be clipped. The default case is that there is no clip path. @ClipPath, @SourceClipBox, PlacedObject/@SourceClipPath and PlacedObject/@ClipBox, if supplied, SHALL be concatenated."
ContentRefs,?,IDREFS,,Ordered list of IDs of Content elements. Content elements provide metadata related to the product to be published.
Docs,?,IntegerRange,,"Zero-based range of document indices in a multi-document file in the context of @Sets that SHALL be selected in the order of the range. If not present, all documents SHALL be selected."
EndOfDocument,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the last page in the RunList is the last page of an instance document. If the RunList references a PDL that supports internal instance documents, @EndOfDocument SHALL be the value that is defined in the PDL. The implied default value of @EndOfDocument=""false"", except for the last RunList Resource with the same explicit or calculated value of Part/@SetIndex, which has an implied default value of @EndOfDocument=""true""."
EndOfSet,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the last page in the RunList is the last page of a set of instance documents. If the RunList references a PDL that supports internal sets, @EndOfSet SHALL be the value that is defined in the PDL. The implied default value of @EndOfSet=""false"", except for the last RunList Resource, which has an implied default value of @EndOfSet=""true""."
FinishedPages,?,integer,,Number of finished page surfaces that one PDL page of this RunList refers to. This attribute SHOULD be used when cover spreads or imposed sheets that contain more than one reader page per PDL page are provided.
LogicalPage,?,integer,,"The logical page number of the first page in a RunList. It defaults to ""1"" plus the last page of the previous sibling RunList partition. If the RunList resource is the first partition, @LogicalPage defaults to ""0"". @LogicalPage SHALL NOT be specified lower than the highest calculated value of @LogicalPage of a previous partition."
NPage,?,integer,,"Total number of pages (placed object slots) that are defined by the RunList. If @NPage is not specified, it defaults to all pages in the referenced PDL. If the RunList describes multiple instance documents or document sets, @NPage refers to the total number of pages in all instance documents and sets. A RunList with @NPage specified always refers to @NPage pages, regardless of the number of pages of the referenced PDL."
OrdType,?,enumeration,OrdType,@OrdType SHALL specify the usage of this RunList element in the context of an Imposition process. Allowed values are: Content - This RunList specifies a set of pages that have content associated. @NPage SHOULD be specified. Insert - This RunList specifies a set of pages that will be inserted from an external feeder. @NPage SHALL be specified. Reservation - This RunList specifies a set of pages that have no content associated. @NPage SHALL be specified.
Pages,?,IntegerRange,,"Zero-based range of indices of the pages in the context of @Docs and @Sets that SHALL be selected in the order of the range. If neither @Pages nor @NPage is specified, all pages in the PDL referred to by the RunList SHALL be selected in document order."
Sets,?,IntegerRange,,"Zero based range of document-set indices in a multi document-set file specified by the RunList that SHALL be selected in the order of the range. If not present, all document sets SHALL be selected."
SourceBleedBox,?,rectangle,,A rectangle that describes the bleed area of the element that SHALL be included. This rectangle is expressed in the source coordinate system of the object.
SourceClipBox,?,rectangle,,A rectangle that defines the region of the element that SHALL be included. This rectangle is expressed in the source coordinate system of the object.
SourceMediaBox,?,rectangle,,A rectangle that defines the intended media size of the element. This rectangle is expressed in the source coordinate system of the object
SourceTrimBox,?,rectangle,,A rectangle that describes the intended trimmed size of the element to be included. This rectangle is expressed in the source coordinate system of the object.
ByteMap,?,element,,"Describes the page or stream of pages. At most one of ByteMap or FileSpec SHALL be specified. If none of ByteMap or FileSpec are specified, the RunList specifies empty content."
FileSpec,?,element,,"URL plus metadata about the physical characteristics of a file representing the RunList. If not present, then only metadata is known but not the content file."
MetadataMap,?,element,,"Describes the mapping of metadata in a RunList to partition keys. MetadataMap SHOULD NOT be specified unless @Automation=""Dynamic""."
