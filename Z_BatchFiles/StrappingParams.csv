StrapPositions,?,FloatList,,"Positions of the straps beginning from the origin of the coordinate system (bottom side) increasing from minimum to maximum in points. Each strap is defined by a 3-tuple of which two values SHALL be 0. The non-zero value specifies the variable coordinate. For instance, two parallel straps shifted along the y-axis are specified as ""0 Y0 0 0 Y1 0"" (see ?Figure 6-41: Strapped bundle and ?Figure 6-42: Strapped bundle with sub-bundles). A centered cross strap in the x-y plane would be specified as ""x/2 0 0 0 y/2 0"", which specifies one strap in the x-plane and another in the y-plane."
