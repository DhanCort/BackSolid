AdjustContrast,?,float,,Specifies the L*a*b* contrast adjustment in the range -100 to + 100. @AdjustContrast SHALL scale the L* channel about mid-scale (where L* = 50). LAdjust = 50 + (L - 50) * (@AdjustContrast / 100 + 1) Note: Increasing the contrast value increases the variation between light and dark areas and decreasing the contrast value decreases the variation between light and dark areas.
AdjustHue,?,float,,Specifies the change in the L*a*b* hue in the range -180 to +180 of all colors by the specified number of degrees of the color circle. aAdjust = a * cos(@AdjustHue) - b * sin(@AdjustHue) bAdjust = a * sin(@AdjustHue) + b * cos(@AdjustHue)
AdjustLightness,?,float,,Specifies the decrease or increase of the L*a*b* lightness in the range -100 to + 100. @AdjustLightness SHALL offset the L* channel. LAdjust += @AdjustLightness. Note: Increasing the lightness value causes the output to appear lighter and decreasing the lightness value causes the output to appear darker.
AdjustSaturation,?,float,,Specifies the increase or decrease of the L*a*b* color saturation in the range -100 to +100. @AdjustSaturation SHALL scale the a* and b* channels around zero.
SourceObjects,?,enumerations,SourceObjects,Identifies which class(es) of incoming graphical objects SHALL be operated on. If @SourceObjects is not specified then ColorCorrectionOp SHALL apply to all object classes.
