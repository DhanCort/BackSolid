MillingDepth,?,float,,"Milling depth, in points. This describes the total cut-off of the spine, regardless of the technology used to achieve this goal."
NotchingDepth,?,float,,"Notching depth relative to the leveled spine, in points. If not specified, no notching SHALL be performed."
NotchingDistance,?,float,,"Notching distance, in points."
Operations,?,NMTOKENS,NMSSpineOperations,List of operations that SHALL be applied to the spine. Duplicate entries SHALL specify a sequence of identical operations. The order of operations is significant. Values include those from: ?Spine Operations.
SealingTemperature,?,integer,,"@SealingTemperature is the temperature needed to melt the sealing thread and sheet, thereby gluing the signatures together. @SealingTemperature SHALL NOT be specified unless @Operations contains ""Sealing""."
StartPosition,?,float,,Starting position of the milling tool along the Y-axis of the operation coordinate system.
WorkingLength,?,float,,"Working length of the milling operation. If not specified, the complete spine SHALL be prepared."
