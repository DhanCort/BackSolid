ClipOffset,?,XYPair,,"Defines the offset (position) of the imaged area in the non-rotated source image when @SizePolicy is ""ClipToMaxPage"". The values ""0.0 0.0"" mean that the imaged area starts at the lower left point of the receiving container. If absent, the imaged area SHALL be taken from the center of the source image."
GutterPolicy,?,enumeration,GutterPolicy,Allows printing of NUp grids even if the media size does not match the requirements of the data. Allowed values are: Distribute – The gutters can grow or shrink to the value specified in @MinGutter. Fixed – The gutters are fixed.
MinGutter,?,XYPair,,Minimum width in points of the horizontal and vertical gutters formed between rows and columns of pages of a multi-up sheet layout. The first value specifies the minimum width of all horizontal gutters and the second value specifies the minimum width of all vertical gutters.
RotatePolicy,?,enumeration,RotatePolicy,Specifies the policy for the device to automatically rotate the content to optimize the fit of the content to the receiving container. Allowed values are: NoRotate – Do not rotate. RotateClockwise – Rotate clockwise by 90°. RotateCounterClockwise – Rotate counterclockwise by 90°. RotateOrthogonal – Rotate by 90° in either direction.
SizePolicy,?,enumeration,SizePolicy,"Allows printing even if the container size does not match the requirements of the data. Allowed values are: Abort – Emit an error and abort printing. ClipToMaxPage – The page contents SHALL be clipped to the size of the container. The printed area is either centered in the source image if no @ClipOffset key is given, or from that position that is determined by @ClipOffset. FitToPage – The page contents SHALL be scaled up or down to fit the container. The aspect ratio SHALL be maintained. ReduceToFit – The page contents SHALL be be scaled down but not scaled up to fit the container. The aspect ratio SHALL be maintained. Tile – The page contents SHALL be split into several tiles, each tile SHALL be printed on its own surface."
