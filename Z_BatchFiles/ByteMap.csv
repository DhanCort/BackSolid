BandOrdering,?,enumeration,BandOrdering,Identifies the precedence given when ordering the produced bands. @BandOrdering SHALL be specified for non-interleaved data and SHALL be ignored for interleaved data if specified. Allowed values are: BandMajor – The position of the bands on the page is prioritized over the color. ColorMajor – All bands of a single color are played in order before progressing to the next plane. This is only possible with non-interleaved data.
FrameHeight,?,integer,,Height of the overall image that MAY be broken into multiple bands
FrameWidth,?,integer,,Width of overall image that MAY be broken into multiple columns.
Halftoned,?,boolean,,"Indicates whether or not the data has been halftoned, e.g. in a previous Screening process."
Interleaved,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the data are interleaved or chunky. Otherwise the data are non-interleaved or planar"
PixelColorants,?,NMTOKENS,,Ordered list of separation identifiers containing information about which colorants are represented. Additional details of the colorants SHOULD be provided in ResourceSet[@Name=”Color”].
PixelDepth,?,integer,,Number of bits per pixel for each colorant.
PixelSkip,?,integer,,Number of bits to skip between pixels of interleaved data.
Resolution,?,integer,,Output resolution of the ByteMap in dpi.
Band,?,element,,Description of the structure of the bands or tiles containing the raster data.
