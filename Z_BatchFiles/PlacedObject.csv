Anchor,?,enumeration,Anchor,Product/@ID of the product that describes the AssemblyItem.
ClipBox,?,rectangle,,Clipping rectangle in terms of the coordinates of the @SurfaceContentsBox.
ClipPath,?,PDFPath,,"Clip path for the PlacedObject in the coordinates of the @SurfaceContentsBox (lower left of @SurfaceContentsBox is used as reference zero point, same as for @ClipBox). The actual clip region is the intersection of @ClipBox and @ClipPath, or the intersection of @ClipBox and @SourceClipPath. In both cases two regions are applied sequentially and the resulting clip region is smaller than either of those regions. @ClipPath and @SourceClipPath SHALL NOT be specified in the same PlacedObject. @ClipPath SHOULD be specified when both @ClipPath and @SourceClipPath are known because @ClipPath provides a more stable coordinate system (not sensitive to shifts caused by editing the page)."
CTM,,matrix,,"The coordinate transformation matrix (CTM — a Postscript term) of the object in the @SurfaceContentsBox. The origin of the source coordinate system is the lower left (expressed in the source coordinate system) of the object and the origin of the destination coordinate system is lower left of the @SurfaceContentsBox. For details, see ?Section 2.6.1.1 Source Coordinate Systems. Note: @CTM SHALL be recalculated if the object is replaced afterwards with a new object with different dimensions."
HalfTonePhaseOrigin,?,XYPair,,Location of the origin for screening of this PlacedObject. Specified in the coordinate system of @SurfaceContentsBox.
ID,?,ID,,Identifier for referencing this PlacedObject
Ord,?,integer,,"@Ord SHALL specify a zero-based reference to an index in the RunList that is selected by the presence of either ContentObject or MarkObject. The index SHALL be incremented for every page in the referenced PDL. The @Ord value of the first page of a RunList SHALL have the value ""0"". If Layout/@Automated=""true"", @Ord MAY be a negative integer. In this case, the explicit @Ord for each iteration of the automated Layout SHALL be calculated by subtracting the appropriate number of @Ord values from the back of the document or the position in the document that is calculated from Layout/ @MaxCollect and Layout/@MinCollect. For details on automated Layout, see ?Section 5.4.8 Imposition."
PositionRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to the Position that defines where this PlacedObject SHALL be located.
SourceClipPath,?,PDFPath,,"Clip path for the PlacedObject in the source coordinate system. @SourceClipPath is applied to the referenced source object in addition to any clipping that is internal to the object. Internal transformation of the source object (Rotation key in PDF, Orientation Tag in TIFF etc.) SHALL be applied prior to applying @SourceClipPath. @ClipPath and @SourceClipPath SHALL NOT be specified in the same PlacedObject. See @ClipPath for more details. See ?Section 2.6.1.1 Source Coordinate Systems for definitions of source coordinate systems."
TrimCTM,?,matrix,,"The transformation matrix of the trim box to be applied to the object’s referenced content in the coordinate system of @SurfaceContentsBox. Note that imposition programs that execute the Layout SHALL recalculate the @CTM in case the referenced content is replaced with new referenced content having different dimensions, otherwise the position of the content inside the trim box will shift. This recalculation is based on @Anchor, @TrimCTM, @TrimSize and trim box. Note: The @TrimCTM attribute may be used by an imposition generation utility when a Layout resource is used as a template for that utility. @TrimCTM SHALL have no effect on processing when a Layout resource is input to the Imposition process."
TrimSize,?,XYPair,,"The size of the object's trim box as viewed in the object source coordinates (@TrimCTM scaling and rotation NOT applied). @TrimSize is needed when replacing the object by a new object with a different dimension. When a Layout resource is input to the Imposition process, @TrimSize specifies the bounding box that SHALL be used for scaling and rotation when processing Layout/FitPolicy. Note: Recalculation of PlacedObject/@CTM is only necessary when the Stripping process or application needs to replace some pages from the provided RunList (using the Layout as a kind of imposition “template”). To ensure correct placement of a new page in the Layout, PlacedObject/@CTM recalculations SHOULD always be done according to PlacedObject/@TrimCTM and PlacedObject/@TrimSize. Together, these two attributes represent the trimming information of the imposition software page, which is not always the same as the original RunList page trimming information. Usage of both PlacedObject elements @TrimCTM and @TrimSize attributes will allow page replacements on any type of imposition Layout."
ContentObject,?,string,,"If a ContentObject is present, this PlacedObject shall be filled from RunList(Document) if it is used in the context of an Imposition or Stripping process. Exactly one of either ContentObject or MarkObject SHALL be present."
MarkObject,?,element,,Details of the production mark. Exactly one of either ContentObject or MarkObject SHALL be present.
PageActivation,?,element,,"PageActivation defines conditions on which page content SHALL be placed in the parent PlacedObject. If PageActivation is present, the page SHALL NOT be filled into that PlacedObject unless the RunList matches a partition specified in any of the PageActivation/Part elements. PageActivation SHALL only be present when Layout/@Automated=""true""."
PageCondition,?,element,,"PageCondition defines conditions on which page content SHALL NOT be placed in the parent PlacedObject. If PageCondition is present, the page SHALL NOT be filled into that PlacedObject if the RunList matches a partition specified in any of the PageCondition/Part elements. PageCondition SHALL only be present when Layout/@Automated=""true"".
