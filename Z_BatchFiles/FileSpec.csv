CheckSum,?,hexBinary,,"Checksum of the file being referenced using the RSA MD5 algorithm. The data type was chosen as hexBinary to accommodate the 128 bit output of the MD5 algorithm. The @CheckSum SHALL be calculated from the entire file, not just parts of the file."
Encoding,?,NMTOKEN,,Encoding or code page of the file contents. Values include those from: ?[IANA-character sets].
FileFormat,?,string,,"A formatting string used with the @FileTemplate attribute to define a sequence of URLs in a batch process, each of which has the same semantics as the @URL attribute. If neither @URL nor @UID is present, both @FileFormat and @FileTemplate SHALL be present, unless the resource is a pipe. If either @URL or @UID is specified, then @FileFormat and @FileTemplate SHALL NOT be specified. Allowed values are from: ?Appendix E String Generation."
FileSize,?,integer,,Size of the file in bytes.
FileTemplate,?,NMTOKENS,,"A template, used with @FileFormat, to define a sequence of URLs in a batch process, each of which has the same semantics as the @URL attribute. If neither @URL nor @UID is present, both @FileFormat and @FileTemplate SHALL be present, unless the resource is a pipe. If either @URL or @UID is specified, then @FileFormat and @FileTemplate SHALL NOT be specified. Allowed values are from: ?Appendix E String Generation"
MimeType,?,string,,"MIME type or file type of the file (or files of identical type when specifying a sequence of file names using the @FileFormat and @FileTemplate attributes). If the file format has a MIME Media Type ?[IANA-mt] registered with IANA, that value SHALL be used. The ?[RFC2046] defines that MIME Media Types are case-insensitive."
OverwritePolicy,?,enumeration,OverwritePolicy,Policy that specifies the policy to follow when a file already exists and the FileSpec is used in an output resource. Allowed values are: Abort – Abort the process without modifying the old file. NewVersion – Create a new file version. Only valid when the FileSpec references a file on a version aware file system. OperatorIntervention – Present a dialog to an operator. Overwrite – Overwrite the old file. RenameNew – Rename the new file. RenameOld – Rename the old file.
Password,?,string,,"Password or decryption key that is needed to read the file contents. Note: Since this password string is not encrypted, it SHOULD only be passed around within a protected environment"
ResourceUsage,?,NMTOKEN,,"If this specification specifies FileSpec(ResourceUsage) in the name column of an element table, then FileSpec/@ResourceUsage SHALL be provided. See ?Table 1.3 Template for Element Descriptions for details. Note: @ResourceUsage is generally required if an element contains more than one FileSpec subelement."
SearchDepth,?,integer,,"Used when FileSpec refers to a directory to specify the maximum directory depth that will be recursively searched. 0 specifies this directory only, -1 specifies an unlimited search."
UID,?,NMTOKEN,,"Internal ID of the referenced file. The @UID SHALL be unique within the workflow. The value of @UID is dependent on the type of file that is referenced: • PDF – Variable unique identifier in the ID field of the PDF file’s trailer. • ICC Profile – The Profile ID in bytes 84-99 of the ICC profile header. • Others – Format specific. If neither @URL nor @UID is present on an input FileSpec, and neither @FileFormat nor @FileTemplate is present, the referencing resource SHALL be a pipe. If either @URL or @UID is specified, then @FileFormat and @FileTemplate SHALL NOT be specified."
URL,?,URL,,"Location of the file specified as either an absolute URI or a relative URI. If neither @URL nor @UID is present on an input FileSpec, and neither @FileFormat nor @FileTemplate is present, the referencing resource SHALL be a pipe. If either @URL or @UID is specified, then @FileFormat and @FileTemplate SHALL NOT be specified. See ?[RFC3986] for the syntax and examples. For the ‘file’ URL scheme see also ?[RFC1738]."
UserFileName,?,string,,A user-friendly name that can be used to identify the file. MAY be used by a controller to identify a file on a device without knowing the file’s internal location.
Disposition,?,element,,Indicates what the device SHOULD do with the file when the process that uses this FileSpec completes. If not specified the file specified by this FileSpec SHOULD NOT be deleted by the device.
