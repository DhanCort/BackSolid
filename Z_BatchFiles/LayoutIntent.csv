Bleed,?,float,,Bleed of the artwork in points. The value of 0 means no bleed. A negative value indicates bleed is needed but the value is unknown.
Dimensions,?,XYPair,,"Specifies the width (X) and height (Y) in points, respectively, of the trimmed and unfolded (flat) product. For example, @Dimensions for a Z-fold is the unfolded dimensions, while @FinishedDimensions is the folded dimensions if known. Use @Dimensions if @FinishedDimensions is not known. @Dimensions is provided for the rare case that @FinishedDimensions does not unambiguously define the finished product, due to complex folding schemes. If both values are specified, @FinishedDimensions takes precedence."
FinishedDimensions,?,shape,,"Specifies the width (X), height (Y) and depth (Z) in points, respectively, of the finished product Component after all finishing operations, including folding, trimming, etc. If the Z coordinate is 0, it SHALL be ignored. Only @FinishedDimensions SHOULD be specified if both @FinishedDimensions and @Dimensions are known."
NamedDimensions,?,NMTOKEN,NMMediaSize,"Named size (e.g., ""A4"" or ""Letter"" that corresponds to the value specified in @FinishedDimensions). If both @NamedDimensions and @FinishedDimensions are specified, then @FinishedDimensions has precedence. See ?Appendix D Media Size for a list of preferred values."
NumberUp,?,XYPair,,"Specifies a regular, multi-up grid of page cells into which content pages are mapped. The first value specifies the number of columns of page cells and the second value specifies the number of rows of page cells in the multi-up grid (both numbers are integers)."
Orientation,?,enumeration,Orientation,"@Orientation SHALL specify the orientation of the artwork on the surface as defined by @Sides. @Orientation is used to define products such as back-lit displays, where the orientation of the image with respect to the final product is rotated or mirrored."
Pages,?,integer,,"Specifies the number of finished pages (surfaces) of the product component, including blank pages. See @SpreadType for a discussion of the scope of @Pages. This value SHALL be an even number. For example, the value for @Pages for a two-sided booklet with seven reader pages would be ""8"", whether the booklet was either saddle stitched or glued."
Sides,?,enumeration,Sides,@Sides specifies which side of the product SHALL be printed.
SpreadType,?,enumeration,SpreadType,"@SpreadType SHALL specify the treatment of individual PDF pages referenced by the DPart node for which @SpreadType is specified for imposition purposes. Allowed values are: SinglePage - The content of each page SHALL be imaged in a single cell in imposition. Each finished page SHALL be counted as an individual page. For instance, a booklet cover would have four pages. Spread - The content of each page SHALL be imaged as a single surface onto the final product. Examples include wraparound covers. Spread SHOULD NOT be provided for adjacent pages that are not imaged onto the same surface. Each surface of the spread SHALL be counted as an individual page. For instance, a wrap around cover would have two pages."
