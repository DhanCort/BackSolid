Center,?,boolean,,"Indicates whether or not the finished page image SHALL be centered within the imagable area of the media. @Center SHALL NOT be specified if FitPolicy/ @SizePolicy=""ClipToMaxPage""."
FilmRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to film Media. This resource provides a description of the physical media that will be marked. The physical characteristics of the media MAY affect decisions made during RasterReading.
MirrorAround,?,enumeration,Axis,This attribute specifies the axis around which a raster reader SHALL mirror an image.
PaperRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to final paper Media. This resource provides a description of the physical media that will be marked. The physical characteristics of the media MAY affect decisions made during RasterReading.
PlateRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to plate Media. This resource provides a description of the physical media that will be marked. The physical characteristics of the media MAY affect decisions made during RasterReading.
Polarity,?,enumeration,Polarity,The image SHALL be RIPed in the polarity specified. Note that this is a polarity change in the RIP and not a polarity change in the hardware of the output device.
ProofPaperRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to paper Media used for proofing. This resource provides a description of the physical media that will be marked. The physical characteristics of the media MAY affect decisions made during RasterReading.
Scaling,?,Scaling,,"A pair of positive real values that indicates the scaling factor for the content. Values between 0 and 1 specify that the contents SHALL be reduced, while values greater than 1 specify that the contents SHALL be expanded. Any scaling defined in FitPolicy SHALL be applied after the scaling defined by this attribute."
ScalingOrigin,?,XYPair,,"A pair of real values that identify the point in the unscaled page that SHALL become the origin of the new, scaled page image. This point is defined in the coordinate system of the unscaled page. If not specified, and scaling is requested, the @ScalingOrigin defaults to ""0 0""."
FitPolicy,?,element,,Allows printing even if the size of the imagable area of the media does not match the requirements of the data.
