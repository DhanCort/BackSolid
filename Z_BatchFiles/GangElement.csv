DueDate,?,dateTime,,The latest date and time the GangElement needs to be included on a gang. The gang engine SHOULD use a combination of @DueDate and @Priority to decide which GangElement elements to place on a gang.
ExternalID,?,NMTOKEN,,"The ID of the product in an external system, e.g. a web to print management system."
FillPriority,?,integer,,"If non-zero, the ganging engine is requested to fill any left over space on the sheet with this GangElement element even if this would lead to over production of the GangElement elements. GangElement elements with a higher priority take precedence over GangElement elements with a lower priority"

GroupCode,?,NMTOKEN,,"Code specifying a group of products. GangElement elements with the same group code MAY be ganged together in a vertical column on the sheet, whereas GangElement elements with different @GroupCode values SHOULD NOT be grouped. This attribute MAY be used to prevent GangElement elements with different colors, ink densities or other incompatible properties to be placed in vertical columns printing on an offset press."
JobID,?,NMTOKEN,,The original @JobID of the element to be ganged.
MaxQuantity,?,integer,,"The maximum number of printed (fold) sheets that may be produced by the gang, including finishing waste"
MediaRef,?,IDREF,,Reference to a Media resource whose characteristics SHALL be met in the gang
MinQuantity,?,integer,,"The minimum number of printed (fold) sheets that SHALL be produced by the gang, including finishing waste."
NPage,?,integer,,"The total number of pages of the GangElement. @NPage SHALL NOT be specified if @BinderySignatureIDs is specified. If @NPage is specified, the number and size of the fold sheets / BinderySignature elements is decided by the ganging engine."
NumberUp,?,XYPair,,"The number up that SHALL be placed on the gang in a single block. If Y is zero, then X SHALL specify the total number-up requested without specifying a specific number in the X or Y direction."
OneSheet,?,NMTOKEN,NMOneSheet,@OneSheet controls how this GangElement SHOULD be placed on ganged sheets. Values include: Any – Place on any sheet that is generated. GangElementID – Keep all blocks with this @GangElementID on one sheet. JobID – Keep all GangElement elements with the same @JobID on the same sheet.
OrderQuantity,,integer,,"The number of printed (fold) sheets to produce, including finishing waste."
PageDimension,?,XYPair,,"The page size, including trims and bleeds, of the element to be ganged. @PageDimension SHALL NOT be specified if @NPage is NOT specified or if either @BinderySignatureIDs or @Dimension is specified."
Priority,?,integer,,"@Priority controls the relative order of including GangElement items in a gang. The value of @Priority SHALL be between ""0"" and ""100"". All GangElement elements with a @Priority=""100"" SHALL be included in the gang. GangElement elements with a @Priority value less than 100 MAY be included in the gang, and SHOULD be included in descending @Priority order."
RotationPolicy,?,enumeration,PositionPolicy,Specifies the level of freedom when applying the values specified in @GrainDirection. Allowed value is from: ?PositionPolicy.
RunListRef,?,IDREF,,"Reference to the content data for this GangElement. If this RunList refers to a structured PDL with multiple document instances such as recipient records in PDF/VT, then this GangElement represents multiple individual sections. These sections SHALL be positioned using the same rules that would apply if each document instance were referenced by an individual GangElement. All document instances referenced by an individual GangElement SHALL be processed in one gang."
SeparationListBack,?,NMTOKENS,,@SeparationListBack SHALL specify the list of separation identifiers that are required for the back side of the product. MAY include varnish. Additional details of the colorants SHOULD be provided in ResourceSet[@Name=”Color”].
SeparationListFront,?,NMTOKENS,,@SeparationListFront SHALL specifies the list of separation identifiers that are required for the front side of the sheet. MAY include varnish. Additional details of the colorants SHOULD be provided in ResourceSet[@Name=”Color”].
