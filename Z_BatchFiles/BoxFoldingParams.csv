BlankDimensionsX,?,FloatList,,@BlankDimensionsX contains a list of the X positions of folds for an unfolded box beginning from the origin of the coordinate system (left side) increasing from minimum to maximum.
BlankDimensionsY,?,FloatList,,@BlankDimensionsY contains a list of the Y positions of folds for an unfolded box beginning from the origin of the coordinate system (bottom side) increasing from minimum to maximum.
BoxFoldingType,,enumeration,BoxFoldingType,Basic predefined folding types. See the drawings referenced from each defined value below. Each drawing is shown from the print side with the lid at the top. Each type MAY be described with a sequence of BoxFoldAction and Glue elements.
BoxFoldAction,*,element,,Individual work step in a box folder-gluer. The sequence of BoxFoldAction and Glue elements SHALL define the sequence of work steps and MAY occur in any order. The first element SHALL be applied first.a
Glue,*,element,,Specification of a glue line. The Glue is applied to the blank in the coordinate system of the folder gluer at the state after all prior BoxFoldActions have been applied. The sequence of BoxFoldAction and Glue elements defines the sequence of work steps and MAY occur in any order. The first element SHALL be applied first.a.
