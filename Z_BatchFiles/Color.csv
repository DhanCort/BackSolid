ActualColorName,?,string,,"Actual name of the color in the PDL. If not specified, the value from ../Part/ @Separation SHALL be used. If @ActualColorName and ../Part/@Separation are different, the separation SHALL be identified by the value of ../Part/ @Separation."
CMYK,?,CMYKColor,,"CMYK value of the 100% tint value of the colorant. @CMYK SHOULD be specified if known and @ColorType != ""Transparent"" and @ColorType != ""DieLine""."
ColorBook,?,string,,Definition of the color identification book name that is used to represent this color. The color book name SHALL match the name defined by the color book vendor.
ColorBookEntry,?,string,,"Definition of the Color within the standard specified by @ColorBook. This entry SHALL match the color book entry exactly as defined by the @ColorBook specified vendor, including capitalization and media type extension. When using ICC profiles, this maps to the NCL2 value of a namedColorType tag of an ICC color profile. This entry is used to map from the XJDF Color to an ICC namedColorType tag"
ColorDetails,?,string,,"A more specific, specialized or site-defined name for the color. If @ColorDetails is supplied, @ColorName SHOULD also be supplied."
ColorName,?,enumeration,,Mapping to a color name.
ColorType,?,enumeration,,A name that characterizes the colorant.
ColorTypeDetails,?,string,,"Additional information about the color type. If @ColorType=""DieLine"", this attribute SHOULD specify the type of die line, e.g. DDES-numbers."
Density,?,float,,"Density value of colorant (100% tint). Whereas @NeutralDensity describes measurements of inks on substrate with wide-band filter functions, @Density is derived from measurements of inks on substrate with special small-band filter functions according to ANSI and DIN."
Gray,?,float,,"Gray value of the 100% tint value of the colorant. @Gray SHALL be specified using a subtractive color model: 0.0 means 100% coverage with colorant, while 1.0 means no coverage."
Lab,?,LabColor,,"L, a, b value of the 100% tint value of the colorant."
NeutralDensity,?,float,,"A number in the range of 0.001 to 10 that represents the neutral density of the colorant, defined as 10*log(1/Y). Y is the tristimulus value in CIEXYZ coordinates, normalized to 1.0."
PrintingTechnology,?,NMTOKEN,NMPrintingTechnologies,"Printing technology of the press, press module or printer that this Color is intended for"
PrintStandard,?,string,,Specifies the reference name of a characterization data set that this color is used in.
RawName,?,hexBinary,,"Representation of the original 8-bit byte stream of the ../Part/@Separation. Used to transport the original byte representation of a ../Part/@Separation when moving XJDF tickets between computers with different locales. Only one Color with any given @RawName SHALL be specified in a ResourceSet[@Name=""Color""]."
sRGB,?,RGBColor,,sRGB value of the 100% tint value of the colorant. @sRGB SHOULD only be used for display purposes.
DeviceNColor,*,element,,Each DeviceNColor element defines the colorant in the DeviceN color space that is defined by DeviceNColor/@Name.
