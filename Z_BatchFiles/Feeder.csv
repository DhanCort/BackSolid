AlternatePositions,?,IntegerList,,"Positions of alternate feeders including the feeder specified in @Position on a feeding chain. Alternate feeders share the load according to the policy defined in @FeederSynchronization. If not specified, it defaults to the value of @Position. @AlternatePositions SHALL be non-negative."
ComponentRef,?,IDREF,,References the Component that SHALL be loaded into this Feeder. This Component SHALL be an input of the Feeding process.
FeederSynchronization,?,enumeration,,Specifies the synchronization of multiple Feeder elements with identical Component elements.
FeederType,?,NMTOKEN,NMFeederType,Specifies the feeder loading.
Loading,?,NMTOKEN,NMLoading,Specifies the feeder loading.
Opening,?,enumeration,,Specifies the opening of signatures.
Position,?,integer,,"@Position of feeder on a collecting and gathering chain in chain movement direction. @Position=""0"" is first feeder feeding to the collecting and gathering chain. Only one Feeder SHALL be specified for any given @Position. If @Position is negative, it specifies the position counted from the back of the chain (e.g., ""-1"" = last position, ""-2"" = next to last position, etc.)."
