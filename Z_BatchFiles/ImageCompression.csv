AntiAliasImages,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", anti-aliasing is permitted on images. If ""false"", anti-aliasing is not permitted. Anti-aliasing increases the number of bits per component in downsampled images to preserve some of the information that would otherwise be lost by downsampling. Anti-aliasing is only performed if the image is actually downsampled and if @ImageDepth has a value greater than the number of bits per color component in the input image."
AutoFilterImages,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the filter defined by @ImageAutoFilterStrategy is applied to photos and the zip compression (""FlateEncode"") filter is applied to screen shots. If ""false"", the @ImageFilter compression method is applied to all images. @AutoFilterImages SHALL NOT be specified unless @EncodeImages is ""true"". This attribute SHALL NOT be specified if @ImageType = ""Monochrome""."
ConvertImagesToIndexed,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", the application converts images that use fewer than 257 colors to an indexed color space for compactness. This attribute is used only when @ImageType = ""Color""."
DCTQuality,?,float,,"A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the amount of compression with which the process SHALL compress images when using a ""DCTEncode"" filter. A value of 0.0 requires that the compression SHOULD be lossless, whereas a value of 1.0 requires the maximum compression possible."
DownsampleImages,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", sampled color images are downsampled using the resolution specified by @ImageResolution. If ""false"", downsampling is not carried out and the image resolution in the PDF file is the same as that in the source file."
EncodeImages,?,boolean,,"If ""true"", images are encoded using the compression filter specified by the value of @ImageFilter. If ""false"", no compression filters are applied to sampled images."
ImageAutoFilterStrategy,?,NMTOKEN,NMImageAutoFilterStrategy,Selects what the image compression strategy to employ if passing through an image that is not already compressed. Values include: JPEG – Lossy JPEG compression for low-frequency images and lossless Flate compression for high-frequency images. JPEG2000 – Lossy JPEG2000 compression for low-frequency images and lossless JPEG2000 compression for high-frequency images.
ImageDepth,?,integer,,"Specifies the number of bits per component in the downsampled image when @DownsampleImages = ""true"". If not specified, the downsampled image has the same number of bits per sample as the original image."
ImageDownsampleThreshold,?,float,,"Sets the image downsample threshold for images. This is the ratio of image resolution to output resolution above which downsampling can be performed. For example, if @ImageDownsampleThreshold=""1.5"" and @ImageResolution=""72"", then the input image would not be downsampled unless it has a resolution greater than (72 * 1.5) = 108 dpi"
ImageDownsampleType,?,enumeration,,Downsampling algorithm for images. Allowed values are: Average – The program averages groups of samples to get the new downsampled value. Bicubic – The program uses bicubic interpolation on a group of samples to get a new downsampled value. Subsample – The program picks the middle sample from a group of samples to get the new downsampled value.
ImageFilter,?,NMTOKEN,NMImageFilter,"Specifies the compression filter to be used for images. Ignored if @AutoFilterImages = ""true"" or if @EncodeImages = ""false"". Values include: CCITTFaxEncode – Used to select CCITT group 3 or 4 facsimile encoding. SHALL NOT be specified unless @ImageType = ""Monochrome"". DCTEncode – Used to select JPEG compression. FlateEncode – Used to select zip compression. JBIG2Encode – Used to select JBIG2 encoding. SHALL NOT be specified unless @ImageType=""Monochrome"". JPEG2000 – Used to select JPEG2000/Wavelet compression. LZWEncode – Used to select LZW compression. PackBits – Used to select a simple byte-oriented run length scheme."
ImageResolution,?,float,,"Specifies the minimum resolution for downsampled color images in dots per inch. This value is used only when @DownsampleImages=""true"". The application downsamples only images whose resolution is above this value."
ImageType,?,enumeration,ImageType,Specifies the kind of image that SHALL be manipulated. Allowed values are: Color Grayscale Monochrome
JPXQuality,?,integer,,"Specifies the image quality. Valid values are greater than or equal to one (1) and less than or equal to 100. One (1) means lowest quality (highest compression), 99 means visually lossless compression, and 100 means numerically lossless compression."
CCITTFaxParams,?,element,,"The equivalent of the PostScript Rows and BlackIs1 parameters, which are implicit in the raster data to be compressed."
DCTParams,?,element,,"The equivalent of the PostScript Columns, Rows and Colors parameters, which are assumed to be implicit in the raster data to be compressed."
FlateParams,?,element,,"The equivalent of the PostScript Columns, BitsPerComponent and Colors parameters, which are implicit in the raster data to be compressed."
JBIG2Params,?,element,,Provides the JBIG2 compression parameters.
JPEG2000Params,?,element,,Provides the JPEG2000 compression parameters.
LZWParams,?,element,,"The equivalent of the PostScript Columns, BitsPerComponent and Colors parameters, which are implicit in the raster data to be compressed."
