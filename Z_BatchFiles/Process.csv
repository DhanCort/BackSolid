Category,?,NMTOKEN,NMNodeCategories,"@Category specifies the named category of this XJDF. Controllers SHOULD specify @Category for processes that have many optional values in @Types. This allows processors to identify the general purpose of an XJDF without parsing the @Types field. For instance, a RIP for final output and a RIP for proof process have identical @Types attribute values, but have @Category = ""ProofRIPing"" or @Category = ""RIPing"", respectively"
CommentURL,?,URL,,"URL SHALL refer to an external, human-readable description of this XJDF."
DescriptiveName,?,string,,Human-readable descriptive name of this XJDF. @DescriptiveName SHOULD be provided for communication from applications to humans in order to reference the XJDF.
ICSVersions,?,NMTOKENS,,@ICSVersions SHALL list all CIP4 Interoperability Conformance Specification (ICS) Versions that this XJDF complies with. The value of @ISCVersions SHALL conform to the value format described in ?Section 3.1.1 ICS Versions Value.
JobID,?,NMTOKEN,,"Job identification used by the application that created the XJDF job. Typically, a job is identified by the internal order number of the MIS system that created the job."
JobPartID,?,NMTOKEN,,@JobPartID SHALL identify one or more worksteps of the same type that can be described as one XJDF. @JobPartID is internal to the MIS system that created the XJDF.
ProjectID,?,NMTOKEN,,Identification of the project context that this XJDF belongs to. @ProjectID SHOULD be used by a controller to group a set of XJDF jobs.
RelatedJobID,?,NMTOKEN,,Job identification of a related job. Used to identify the @JobID of a previous run of this job or job with very similar settings. It MAY be used to retrieve additional job and device specific settings from a data store.
RelatedJobPartID,?,NMTOKEN,,Job identification of a related job part. Used to identify the @JobPartID of a previous run of this job or job with very similar settings. It MAY be used to retrieve additional job and device specific settings from a data store.
RelatedProjectID,?,NMTOKEN,,Identification of a related project context that this XJDF belongs to. @RelatedProjectID SHOULD be used by a controller to group a set of XJDF jobs.
Types,,NMTOKENS,,"A list of one or more process names that are specified within this XJDF document. For details on using processes, see ?Section 3.1.3 XJDF for Process Description and Gray Boxes. A value of @Types that contains ""Product"" specifies that the products that are described shall be produced without complete knowledge of the production workflow. Additional process specifics MAY be supplied in a ticket that contains ""Product""."
xmlns,,URI,,"XJDF supports use of XML namespaces. For details on using namespaces in XML, see ?[XMLNS]. For version 2.0 of XJDF, @xmlns = ""http://www.CIP4.org/JDFSchema_2_0""."
AuditPool,?,element,,List of elements that contains all relevant audit information. AuditPool elements are intended to serve the requirements of MIS for evaluation and post calculation.
Comment,*,element,,Any human-readable text. The Comment element is different from an XML comment . The XJDF comment is meant for display in a user interface whereas the XML comment is used to add developer’s comments to the underlying XML.
GeneralID,*,element,,Additional identifiers related to the XJDF.
ProductList,*,element,,"Bill of materials - description of the product, or products that this XJDF produces."
ResourceSet,*,element,,Container elements for Resource elements
