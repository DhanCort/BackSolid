AllowedRotate,?,enumeration,,Allowed methods to rotate structural designs with respect to grain/flute.
GutterX,?,float,,Gutter between columns (see also @GutterX2).
GutterX2,?,float,,Secondary gutter between columns. The gutter between columns (2n+0) and (2n+1) is @GutterX and between columns (2n+1) and (2n+2) is @GutterX2. When @GutterX2 is not specified @GutterX2=@GutterX.
GutterY,?,float,,Gutter between rows (see also @GutterY2).
GutterY2,?,float,,Secondary gutter between rows. The gutter between rows (2n+0) and (2n+1) is @GutterY and between rows (2n+1) and (2n+2) is @GutterY2. When @GutterY2 is not specified @GutterY2=@GutterY.
LayoutStyle,?,NMTOKENS,NMSLayoutStyle,The allowed styles for the layout.
OrderQuantity,?,integer,,The order quantity for the 1-up for which this layout will be optimized. This information SHALL be present when a layout is being made for more than one ShapeDef.
ShapeDefRef,,IDREF,,Reference to a ShapeDef describing the 1-up structural design that SHALL to be stepped and repeated on the DieLayout.
UseBleed,?,boolean,,"If true, the print bleed defined in the structural design SHALL be used to calculate the layout. If false, the outer cut SHALL be used."
