TabEdge,?,enumeration,Edge,"Indicates which edge of the media has tabs. Sets the coordinate system for @TabOffset, @TabExtensionDistance, and @TabWidth."
TabExtensionDistance,?,float,,The positive distance in points that the tab extends beyond the body of the other media.
TabOffset,?,float,,Specifies the magnitude of the distance in points from the two corners to the edge of the first “tab pitch” point of the first tab in the bank along the @TabEdge. This distance is the same on both ends of the bank of tabs.
TabSetCollationOrder,?,enumeration,TabSetCollationOrder,Collation order of media provided in sets. Applicable to sets of pre-cut tabs.
TabsPerBank,?,integer,,Specifies the number of equal-sized tabs in a single bank if all positions were filled.
TabWidth,?,float,,The width along the @TabEdge of each tab as measured along the mid-line of the tab.
